# ðŸ“„ Product Vision Document â€” Collab-NFT

## Project Overview

**Collab-NFT** is a collaborative Web3 dApp that empowers multiple users to
contribute pixel data to a shared canvas, resulting in a collective piece of
digital art. Upon completion, the artwork is minted as a fully on-chain NFT on
the **Sui Blockchain**, with revenues from its sale automatically and
transparently distributed among all contributors through smart contracts.

## SUI Framework Usage & Integration

- Seamless integration with the **Sui Blockchain** ensures low transaction costs
  and high throughput.
- Leveraging the **@mysten/dapp-kit** for wallet connection, transaction
  management, and real-time on-chain updates.
- Smart contracts developed specifically for pixel recording, NFT minting, and
  revenue sharing without intermediaries.

## Technical Implementation and Documentation

- Built with a modern stack: **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **Radix
  UI** ensuring scalability and maintainability.
- Fully documented project repository including clear setup guides, development
  instructions, and deployment processes.
- Clean, modular code structure and adherence to ESLint standards ensure a
  high-quality development practice.

## Applicability and Impact Potential

- Offers a new decentralized standard for collective digital art ownership and
  monetization.
- Enables Web3 communities and DAOs to create and co-own unique artworks.
- Provides a proof-of-concept for decentralized creative collaboration at scale.

## Presentation and Demo Quality

- Live demonstration features real-time wallet integration, canvas contribution,
  and NFT minting.
- Fully functional and intuitive UI, delivering a frictionless user experience.
- End-to-end flow from wallet connection to NFT creation showcased clearly
  during the demo.

## Innovation and Originality

- Introduces a **pixel-by-pixel collective art creation mechanism** integrated
  natively with blockchain technologies.
- Fully decentralized and transparent revenue sharing based on immutable
  contribution records.
- No central authority controls creation or sales â€” full ownership remains with
  the contributors.

## Decentralization and Transparency

- All contributions and revenue sharing logic are verifiable on-chain.
- No hidden logic or off-chain manipulation â€” complete transparency and user
  trust.

## Token Economy

- Revenue from NFT sales is distributed algorithmically based on each
  contributor's recorded pixel input.
- Future versions could allow for advanced tokenomics like contributor staking
  or revenue boosts based on participation.

# Success Metrics

- Achieve over 100 unique contributors per minted artwork.
- Complete NFT minting with 100% on-chain verifiability and error-free user
  transactions.
- Build an active community around collective creation projects with high
  participant satisfaction scores.
